**Overview**

2048: *Combine Numbers!* is inspired by the original [2048](https://play2048.co/) game.

The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to a create a new tile numbered 2048. The game will start with only two numbered tiles in random positions, and each will have a value of either 2 or 4.

Depending on which arrow key you press, the grid will slide to that direction. The tiles with the same number will merge, creating a new tile with double the number.
